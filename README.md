## *The Growth Mindset*
  
  
 The growth mindset is a way of reacting to challenges that come your way. It is through development and perseverance that a person can grow and continue to learn. There is power in knowing but there is even more power and great humility in saying _I donâ€™t know but I will find out_.  In contrast a stagnant mind will give up too easily and find ways around learning something new. 
  
  Below is a table that shows the diffrent thoghts a stagnant mind and a growing mind would think
  
  Stagnant Mind | Situation | Growing Mind
------------ | ------------- | --------------
"This is too hard. I want to quit" | Effort | "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.-Wayne Gretzky" -Michael Scott
"They try too hard" | Others Success | "How can I do that?"
"But we've always do it this way" |Change| "Thats a different way of thinking. Let do it"
