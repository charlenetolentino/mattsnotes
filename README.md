## *The Growth Mindset*
  
  
 The growth mindset is a way of reacting to challenges that come your way. It is through development and perseverance that a person can grow and continue to learn. There is power in knowing but there is even more power and great humility in saying _I donâ€™t know but I will find out_.  In contrast a stagnant mind will give up too easily and find ways around learning something new.
