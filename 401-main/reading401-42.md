# Ethics in Tech

## Article 1 [The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

I found this article very interesting. The article follows a person who writes code for a pharmaceutical company. The code is a test targeting young adolescents. The drug ended up killing a teen from the side effects. The developer finishes on the side of his morality and decided to resign from the company. This is the worst thing that has ever happened to him and I totally understand that the developer in this situation. It does not matter if the developer has a responsive entity. It was his job to write a program for his job. The Develop had no way knowing this would happen. Overall, what I got out of this was that pharmaceutical  companies are all garbage and I would not work for them

## Article 2 [Ethical dilemma of self driving cars](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/technology/the-ethical-dilemmas-of-self-drivingcars/article37803470/)


This article is about autonomous vehicles and how the vehicle decides to act in the event of an accident. If a child suddenly jumps in front of a car, which way should the car go? It's apparently a big debate and hasn't really been addressed in the auto industry. I really hope there will be extensive testing before launching an autonomous vehicle. this is a great scenario to bring inn AI if it ever gets good enough to make this kind of reaction.  I think a machine can make a better shared decision given the right configuration.
