## Article 1 [The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)

I found this article very interesting. The article follows a person who writes code for a pharmaceutical company. The code is a test targeting young adolescents. The drug ended up killing a teen from the side effects. The developer finishes on the side of his morality and decided to resign from the company. This is the worst thing that has ever happened to him and I totally understand that the developer in this situation. It does not matter if the developer has a responsive entity. It was his job to write a program for his job. The Develop had no way knowing this would happen. Overall, what I got out of this was that pharmaceutical  companies are all garbage and I would not work for them
