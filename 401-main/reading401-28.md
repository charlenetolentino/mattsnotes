Questions:


1. Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
    - react renders everything on one page
2. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?
    - inside the the \<BrowserRotuer/> because you want it to have access to the component where we declare our pages
3. Who does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
4. Who does props.children contain?
    - properties on the children component
5. How do useState() and this.setState() differ?
    - this.setState is a class component and useState() is a functional one
