# Reading prep for 401

## Readings:

### [Solving Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

  - Notes:
    - Resist the urge to start writing code as soon as possible
    - Take plenty of time to try to understand the problem
    - Here are some steps to follow outlined by the reading:
      1. Read the problem completely twice
      1. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data
      1. Optimize the manual steps
      1. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
      1. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code
      1. Optimize the real code


### [How to Think like a Programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)

  - Notes:
    - Problem solving is a meta-skill
    - Ask a lot of questions about problem domain
    - Try to explain the problem in simple words
    - Have a plan on how to tackle problem instead of jumping right in
    - Try to breakdown problem into smaller problems
    - Practice practice practice

### [The 5 Why's](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

  - Notes:
    - This technique was developed by Sakichi Toyoda the inventor and founder of Toyota Industries
    - The 5Y uses counter-measures rather than solutions
    - A counter-measure is an action or set of actions that seeks to prevent the problem from arising
    - Here are the steps to using the 5Y's:
      1. Assemble a team
      1. Define the Problem
      1. Ask why the problem is happening
      1. Ask why 4 more times for the previous answer to the last why
      1. Know when to stop
      1. Address the root problem from asking why
      1. Monitor the fix

## Videos:

### [Who the Heck is an Eventloop?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

- Notes:
 - The events loops job is to look at the stack and look at the task queue. If the stack is empty it takes the first thing on the queue and pushes it onto the stack.
 - The callback queue is a holding place for code that has finished execution and needs to rejoin the main queue
 - You should not clack the call stack for the site to render properly

### [The Super Mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)

  - Notes:
    - When there is no penalty users will try more often and have a higher success rate.
    - Celebrate the successes
    - Focus on the end goal
    - Don't dwell on the failures
