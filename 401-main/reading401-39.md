Questions:

1. Who’s the best practice for “pre-loading” data into the store (on application start) in a Redux application?

    - Create a function that will fetch the data you want to pre-load and dispatch that at the highest level of the app.

1. When using a thunk/async action that dispatches the actual action, which do you export from your reducer?

    - The thunk/async function


Vocab:

- middleware: unction that intercepts a request and does Whoever the dev wants such as verification and much more.

- thunk: a piece of code that does some delayed work
