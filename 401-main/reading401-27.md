Questions:

  -  Vanilla JavaScript usually starts with some HTML already created. React begin life with an empty HTML page and dynamically create the HTML rendering using react libraries. 

2. What is the primary difference between a function component and a class component?

  - A functional component is just a plain JavaScript function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element. A class component requires you to extend from React.

Vocab: 

Functional Components - These are basic JS functions and usually an arrow function in ES6. Sometimes referred to stateless components as do not render anything to the UI other than the data.

Children / Child Components - Components that live under the parent component. Parents are able to pass information to the child component.
