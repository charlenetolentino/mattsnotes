## Questions:

1. What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?
  <ul>
      <li>PUT replaces an entire resource if it exists or creates a new one if it didn't. PATCH updates that resource </li>
    </ul>

2. Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

  <ul>
      <li>Beeceptor</li>
      <li>Postman Mock Server</li>
      <li>Mocky.io</li>
    </ul>

3. Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

  <ul>
      <li>Swagger is a free cloud-based API testing and documentation tool. APIDoc looks to be a library for APIs? </li>
    </ul>

4. Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

   <ul>
      <li>1xx - Informational</li>
      <li>2xx - Success</li>
      <li>3xx - Redirection</li>
      <li>4xx - Client Error</li>
      <li>5xx - Server Error</li>
    </ul>

5. Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST

  <ul>
      <li>SOAP: 'allows developers to invoke processes running on disparate operating systems  to authenticate, authorize, and communicate using Extensible Markup Language '</li>
      <li>REST: 'The goal of REST is to increase performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability. This is achieved through following REST principles such as a client–server architecture, statelessness, cacheability, use of a layered system, support for code on demand, and using a uniform interface. These principles must be followed for the system to be classified.'</li>
    </ul>

## Vocab:

<ul>
      <li>Web Server - A computer that runs a website </li>
      <li>Express - A Node.js web application framework for web and mobile applications</li>
      <li>Routing - the process of declaring a path for a method to retrieve, update or delete a resourse but calling a callback function</li>
      <li>WRRC - web request response cycle</li>
    </ul>

## Preview:

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
  - super test, tests in general, debugging error handler

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
