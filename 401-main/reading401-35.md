1. Vertex - A vertex, or also called a node, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
1. Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes
1. Neighbor - Neighbors are connected via edges
1. Degree - the number of edges connected to that vertex
1. Undirected Graph - where the edge is undirected or bi-directional. Meaning that the graph does not move in any specific direction
1. Directed Graph - Each node is directional and pointing where the data will flow using the next reference in the node
