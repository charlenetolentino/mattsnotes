# Context API - Behaviors

[Home](/README.md) | [Back](/401-main/401TableofContents.md)

Questions:


1. When you have multiple contexts, what component type should you use (class/function) and why?

  - Personally I like functioanl more because right now it is the easiest that I can conprehend

2. What are some good use cases for using the Context API for global state?

  - Auth and themes?

3. How can you best test context?

  - when more than one component can use it



Vocab: 

context - a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
useContext() - Accepts a context object (the value returned from `React.createContext`) and returns the current context value for that context.
static context - for values that dont need to initialize a component


Preview:

  - react in general is still pretty weak for me


Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

  - more examples of contexted used

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

  - I am excited about everything
