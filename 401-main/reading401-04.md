Questions:

1. Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

- make sure your functions are being called properly, Make devlopment faster, better qualtiy code

1. In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

- as the name sake for them, you'd use one or the other before or after a test

1. What is one downside of Test Driven Development

- can be time consuming without proper planning and if you don't write tests correctly you could have false positives

- The use of a class instaed of a function 

1. Why REST?

- more flexible

Vocab:

functional programming:  functional programming is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions

object-oriented programming (OOP): a programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Lanuages such as Ruby, Java and Python

class: a way to create an object

super: a keyword used to access functions from the parent

this: a keyword that refers to the object it belongs to
Test Driven Development (TDD): a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully complete

Jest: a JS testing framwork

Continuous Integration (CI): software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository

REST:  software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the internet

Data Model: organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another like a wireframe or UM:
