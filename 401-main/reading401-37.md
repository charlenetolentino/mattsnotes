# Redux - Combined Reducers


[Home](/README.md) | [Back](/401-main/401TableofContents.md)

Questions:

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
    - redux is better suited for state management
2. Who is the purpose of a reducer?
    - take 2 values, conmbine them, and return the new value
3. Who does an action contain?
    - the type and payload
4. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
    - state as is immutable so you must return new


Vocab:

- immutable state: state that cannot change such as initial state
- time travel in redux: ability to move back and forth among previous states
- action creator: action functions that takes in a type and payload to show later
- reducer: a fucntion that takes in a precious value combines with as second value. The result id then returned 
- dispatch: a fucntion that calls an action
