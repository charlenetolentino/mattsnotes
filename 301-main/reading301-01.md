        <li> 	Extendable - Can be used with existing components to provide new behavior </li>
        <li> 	Encapsulated - Does not expose internal process while executing code</li>
        <li>	Independent - Components are designed to have few dependencies on others </li>
      </ol>
  1. Who are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
      <ol>
        <li>	Ease of Deployment – When new or more refined versions become more available, they are easily implemented</li>
        <li>	Reduced cost – Using third-party components makes your overall cost lower on development and maintenance</li>
        <li>	Ease of Development – Using trusted already made components helps build your own component more reliable and easier to use</li>
        <li>	Reusable – Can be used to aide others create their own components </li>
        <li>	Modification of Technical Complexity – makes parts in component easier to read</li>
        <li>	Reliability – If all components are implemented properly the system benefits</li>
        <li>	System Maintenance and Evolution – Easy to change and update</li>
        <li>	Independent – Works well on its own but also can add to another to improve </li>
