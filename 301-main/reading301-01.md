## [What is a Component?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm) 

Questions:

  1. What is a component?
     <ul>
      <li> A component is a set if reusable code that is meant to interact with other objects or other components</li>
      </ul>
  1. What are the characteristics a component?
      <ol>
        <li>	Reusability: components are mostly written to be reused. Very few are designed for only one task </li>
        <li>	Reusability - components are mostly written to be reused. Very few are designed for only one task</li>
        <li> 	Not Context Specific - Components are designed to operate in different situation and contests </li>
        <li> 	Extendable - Can be used with existing components to provide new behavior </li>
        <li> 	Encapsulated - Does not expose internal process while executing code</li>
        <li>	Independent - Components are designed to have few dependencies on others </li>
      </ol>
  1. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
      <ol>
        <li>	Ease of Deployment – When new or more refined versions become more available, they are easily implemented</li>
        <li>	Reduced cost – Using third-party components makes your overall cost lower on development and maintenance</li>
        <li>	Ease of Development – Using trusted already made components helps build your own component more reliable and easier to use</li>
        <li>	Reusable – Can be used to aide others create their own components </li>
        <li>	Modification of Technical Complexity – makes parts in component easier to read</li>
        <li>	Reliability – If all components are implemented properly the system benefits</li>
        <li>	System Maintenance and Evolution – Easy to change and update</li>
        <li>	Independent – Works well on its own but also can add to another to improve </li>
      </ol>
