Questions: 

1. What is functional programming?

    <ul>
      <li>Wikipedia definition: Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data </li>
    </ul>

1. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

    <ul>
      <li>If given the same arguments the returned result will be the same AND the result doesn;t have any observable side effects</li>
    </ul>

1. What are the benefits of a pure function?

    <ul>
      <li>the code is easier to test</li>
    </ul>

1. What is immutability?

    <ul>
      <li>its state that cannot change after its created</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Allows you to use other files in the other file that needs a module</li>
    </ul>
