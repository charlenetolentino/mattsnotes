##  Tables  

A table is used to represent information in a grid format. The gird will allow us to understand complex data by showing data points on two axes. Like your favorite spreadsheeting app, Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, each block is referred as a table cell. Here is an example of what creating a table using HTML tags look like.

Basic Structure:

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th> Numbers 1, 4, 7</th>
        <th> Numbers 2, 5, 8</th>
        <th> Numbers 3, 6, 9</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 1 </td>
        <td> 2 </td>
        <td> 3 </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 4 </td>
        <td> 5 </td>
        <td> 6 </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> 7 </td>
        <td> 8 </td>
        <td> 9 </td>
      </tr>
    </table>

 Numbers 1, 4, 7 | Numbers 2, 5, 8 | Numbers 3, 6, 9
- | - | -

## Objects

<ul>
      <li>An object is a collection of variables and functions that represent a real item in the world </li>
      <li>You can create an empty object and give it properties and methods outside using dot notation.   </li>
      <li>  You can update a property using dot notation or square brackets. Note if the property or method arenâ€™t already in the object then this will create a new one.   </li>
      <li> JS has some already built-in objects such as String, Math, Date and Number. </li>
      <li>You can store an object in an array and vis versa  </li>
    </ul>
