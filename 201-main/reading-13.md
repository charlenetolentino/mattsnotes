## Local Storage History

<ul>
  <li>Cookies are better for small amounts of data but can slow down your browsing experience</li>
  <li>Before HTML5, Microsoft invented a behavior called userData</li>
  <li>userData lets web pages store up to 64KB of data per domain and 10x that amount on trusted intranet domains</li>
  <li>Other companies like Adobe and Google had attempted to create their solution to a local storage but none came on top</li>
  <li>HTML5 introduced Local or DOM storage</li>
  <li>This feature allows web pages to store name/value pairs locally in the client browser</li>
  <li>The named key is a string and the data can be any type supported by JavaScript </li>
  <li>Remember to us parseInt() when comparing different data types</li>
  <li>The storage event is not cancelable</li>
  <li>5 megabytes is the local storage capacity</li>
  <li>HTML5 storage can save progress locally within the browser for when you close the browser mid-activity and just reopen when you are ready to resume </li>
</ul>
