## Images

You can control the size of an image in CSS using pixel size for the width and the height. In doing so you can then call that same size of the photo in on several images on different pages of your site. The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box but can also appear just once. 

Here is an example of what a background image not repeating and positioned to the bottom right:

    body{
      background-image: url("images/tulip.gif);
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-postion: right bottom;
    }
