## Images

  An image can help style and give personal touches to a web page. The photos must be relevant to the site and well be presented in an easy to look at manner. When using photos proper credit is imperative when posting. Ask permission for the owner to use the image. This might bring up certain license agreements with them. Stock photos are an option, but you still need to provide credit to the artist. 

Using the \<img> tag you can call an image locally in the web file. Inside the \<img> tag you can also name a few attributes. 

<ul>
      <li> scr = - This tells the browser where to find the image </li>
      <li> atl= - Provides a description of an image </li>
      <li> title= - This provides a title for the image on the backend </li>
    </ul>

You can also specify the height and width inside the HTML

<ul>
      <li> width= - Specify the width in pixels  </li>
      <li> height= - Specify the height in pixels  </li>
    </ul>

<b> NOTE WHEN ADDING A PHOTO:</b>

<i>Make sure that the image is the highest quality that you can obtain. When resizing or cropping a photo a high-res photo can look great big or small but a low=res photo will look pixilated and distorted if resized to big. To resize or crop you will need to use a third part application. </i>
