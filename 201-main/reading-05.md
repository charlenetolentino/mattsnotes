## Images

  An image can help style and give personal touches to a web page. The photos must be relevant to the site and well be presented in an easy to look at manner. When using photos proper credit is imperative when posting. Ask permission for the owner to use the image. This might bring up certain license agreements with them. Stock photos are an option, but you still need to provide credit to the artist. 

Using the \<img> tag you can call an image locally in the web file. Inside the \<img> tag you can also name a few attributes. 

<ul>
      <li> scr = - This tells the browser where to find the image </li>
      <li> atl= - Provides a description of an image </li>
      <li> title= - This provides a title for the image on the backend </li>
    </ul>

You can also specify the height and width inside the HTML

<ul>
      <li> width= - Specify the width in pixels  </li>
      <li> height= - Specify the height in pixels  </li>
    </ul>

<b> NOTE WHEN ADDING A PHOTO:</b>

<i>Make sure that the image is the highest quality that you can obtain. When resizing or cropping a photo a high-res photo can look great big or small but a low-res photo will look pixilated and distorted if resized to big. To resize or crop you will need to use a third part application. </i>

## Color

Color is an integral part to adding more style to the web page. Choosing the right color palate or theme will drastically change the mood of the user. Colors can bring out emotions or change the feelings of the person looking at it. The contrast and opacity also need to be considered when thinking about readability and style. Low contrast between colors can be hard to read where a high contrast is the easiest to read but is harder on the eyes. A medium contrast will provide the best of both worlds, easy to read and not too hard on the eyes for longer reading periods. 

There are few ways to call a color to an element in CSS. 

<ol>
      <li> RGB values - { rgb(100,200,90) }; </li>
      <li> Hex codes - { #ffffff }; </li>
      <li> Color name - { yellow }; </li>
    </ol>

In CSS3 there are a few more ways to denote color using HSL, HSLA, and RGBA. HSL stands for Hue Saturation and Lightness. Using a color wheel denoted between 0-360 degrees you can select a color. Saturation and lightness are both denoted in percentages. The A in HSLA and AGBA both mean Alpha (opacity) or the transparency of the color denoted in a number between 0 and 1.0.

<ol>
      <li> HSL – { hsl(75,56%,50%); } </li>
      <li> HSLA – { hlsa(75,56%,50%,0.5);   </li>
      <li> RGBA – { rgba (100,200,90,0.5); </li>
    </ol>
