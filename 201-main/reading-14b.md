[Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/Who-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)


### Teamwork in Study Groups
<ul>
  <li> 	Julia Rozovsky was a student who was accepted into the Yale School of Management</li>
  <li>She joined a study group with four other students to discuss homework assignments and study for exams</li>
  <li>Everyone in her study group was similar in a sense that they were all smart and had gone to similar colleges</li>
  <li>Because of their shared experiences, Julia thought her group would work well together, but she was wrong</li>
  <li>Because of their shared experiences, Julia thought her group would work well together, but she was wrong</li>
  <li>Her study group constantly criticized each other, competed for leadership roles, and they were not compatible</li>
  <li> Julia later joined a different study group that had people of different backgrounds and they all worked much better together than her previous study group</li>
</ul>


### Work Habits Examined in Data

<ul>
  <li> 	Today, many university studies, psychologists, sociologists, and statisticians are trying to figure out how employees can become better and more productive</li>
  <li>Analyzing individual workers, also known as “employee performance optimization”, isn’t enough and it is beneficial to study teams and how they work together</li>
  <li>Most work today is collaborative because it has many benefits such as finding solutions more quickly and a higher job satisfaction</li>
</ul>

### Finding the perfect Google team

<ul>
  <li> Google spent millions of dollars measuring every aspect of its employees’ lives and habits	</li>
  <li>They also examined Who traits the best managers have</li>
  <li>In 2012, Google started an initiative, code-named Project Aristotle, to study hundreds of Google’s teams and figure out why some worked better than others</li>
  <li>Julia Rozovsky was then hired by Google and assigned to Project Aristotle</li>
</ul>

### Project Aristotle

<ul>
  
  <li>The researchers of Project Aristotle began looking at patterns in the ways teams worked together to see if there were certain traits that made a team successful</li>
  <li>They found that there were no patterns in a team’s success and no two teams were alike</li>
  <li>Rozovsky and her team started to look at “group norms”, which are the traditions, behavioral standards, and unwritten rules in how groups work together</li>
  <li> Her team found that a lot of teams didn’t have group norms in common and all the groups were different in Who norms made them successful</li>
  <li>The researchers did find that there were two behaviors that the good teams shared. Each member spoke in the same proportion, something that they called “equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking”. Successful teams also had everyone speak about the same amount</li>
  <li>Successful teams also had high “average social sensitivity”, which means team members could tell how another person felt based on the tone of their voice, their expressions, and nonverbal cues</li>
  <li>Rovosky said that her study group at Yale was draining because of their norms-fights over leadership and criticizing each other put her on guard</li>
  <li>Her other group was better for her because they were enthusiastic about each other’s ideas, joking around and having fun, which allowed everyone to feel relaxed</li>
  <li>Their next goal after finding successful group norms was to establish psychologically safe environments</li>
  <li>To achieve this, they started surveys, conducting interviews, and analyzing statistics with Google employees</li>
</ul>


### Psychological Safety
<ul>
  
  <li>Project Aristotle had someone named Matt Sakaguchi help them with their research on psychological safety </li>
  <li>He conducted a survey on his team and found that they felt there was weaknesses in the team that Sakaguchi wasn’t aware of</li>
  <li>Sakaguchi shared with his team that he had stage 4 cancer. After that, the rest of his team shared other things in their lives that were bothering them</li>
  <li>Sakaguchi didn’t have to share something personal about himself, but he thought that psychological safety was related to empathy and creating human bonds</li>
  <li>Project Aristotle taught people at Google that no one wants to put on a “work face” and separate their life from work because people spend most of their time working and it is a huge part of their life</li>
  <li>To feel “psychologically safe”, employees must feel comfortable to share things that scare them without being judged</li>
  <li>In the most successful teams, members listen to each other and show sensitivity to their colleagues’ feelings and needs</li>

</ul>
