## Structure

One way to think about how to structure a web page is to think of it like a newspaper (remember those?). On a newspaper there are titles, headings, and bodies of paragraphs but instead of typing up a word document and editing the font size and shape you will need to identify these different sections with HTML tags. These tags usually come in pairs showing you where that section begins and ends.  

For expample:

    <h1> This is the main heading </h1>
    <p> This is where a paragraph will go </p>
    <h2> This would be a second heading <h2>

It is vital to learn all the HTML tags to know which are appropriate to use at certain times.

## Extra Markup

**ID Attribute:**

    <p id="insert text">

Used to ***uniquely*** identify that element form the others on the page

**Class Attrubute:**

    <p class="insert text">

Used to identify ***several*** elements as being different 

**Block Elements:**

    <h1></h1>
    <p></p>
    <ul></ul>

These are used to crete a new line on the window

**iframes:**

    <iframe
    width = "x"
    height = "x"
    img=>

    </iframe>

This is used when you want to create a little window inside the web browser

## HTML5 Layout

In previous versions of HTML, the \<div> command was used to id related elements on the page. HTML5, the most recent version and the version that we use in class, took the most used \<div> elements and created their very own HTML tag.

**Pre-HTML5**

    <div id="header">
    <div id="nav">
    <div id="article>

**HTML5**

    <header>
    <nav>
    <article>

The use of these elements provides a cleaner code and make it easier for screen reading software to read pertinent information like the body of an article instead of information on the header and footer of the web page. In addition, these new tags can be used by search engine to provide more accurate search results 

## Process and Design 

When creating a website, it is important to design it for a target audience in mind. 
Here are a few questions you want to ask when you are at the early stages of building a website:

**Who is the site for?**

Every website has a target audience. They can be as broad as a Facebook audience where the platform must be user friendly for a variety of age, occupation, county of origin, and gender or it can be more specific like PBS Kids where their target audience is mainly kids. Once you identify who you want to use your website it will be easier to build around those needs.

**Why are people visiting your website?**

Most visitors will come to your site for a specific reason. You can determine these reasons by asking what their key motivations are and what are their specific goals.

**What inforamtion your visitor needs?**

After learning who is coming to your site and why, you need to find out what information they need to reach their goals quickly. Are these subject matter experts with tons of experience and knowledge or are they novices who need background information on a product or services that you are providing?

Once you have learned all you can about the visitor you can now create a site map and the wireframes for each page. 

**SiteMap**

A site map will help you plan the final structure of your site

**Wireframe**

A wireframe will help you creat  the layout of every web page.
