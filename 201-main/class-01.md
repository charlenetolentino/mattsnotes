## Structure

One way to think about how to structure a web page is to think of it like a newspaper (remember those?). On a newspaper there are titles, headings, and bodies of paragraphs but instead of typing up a word document and editing the font size and shape you will need to identify these different sections with HTML tags. These tags usually come in pairs showing you where that section begins and ends.  

For expample:

    <h1> This is the main heading </h1>
    <p> This is where a paragraph will go </p>
    <h2> This would be a second heading <h2>

It is vital to learn all the HTML tags to know which are appropriate to use at certain times.
