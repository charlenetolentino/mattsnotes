## Charts

Charts are a good way to show data in a meaningful way and are more visually appealing than tables. Using a combination of HTML and JavaScript, you can make a line chart, pie chart, and a bar chart on the rendered page. 


The \<canvas> tag will have and id attribute as well as a set width and height. The ID attribute is the way into the DOM from the JS. 

The tag will look like this:

    <canvas id="cookie-sales" width="600" height="400"></canvas>

Inside the JS you will be creating data and one way to do so is by making an Object. Depending what chart you want to create the data needed will look different.
