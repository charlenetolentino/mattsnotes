      <li> Gently mix in eggs yolks </li>
    </ol>

<ol>
      <li> Fold in egg whites </li>
      <li> Sift in Flour </li>
      <li> Gently mix in eggs yolks </li>
    </ol>

The unordered list can list out a grocery list.

HTML Example:

      <ul>
        <li> Eggs </li>
        <li> Flour </li>
        <li> Milk </li>
      </ul>

<ul>
      <li> Eggs </li>
      <li> Flour </li>
      <li> Milk </li>
    </ul>

## CSS Boxes

In CSS the HTML elements are treated as its very own box. To those boxes can control the dimensions, create styles borders around them, set the margin and the padding space between and also show a hide them. 

A couple things to keep in mind when styling your boxes:

<ol>
  <li> When choosing to dimension you can give those values using a pixel count, percentages, or em. 
  <li> Make sure to add a minimum and maximum width so that the text does not looks so wide on the screen
  <li> Adding border margin and padding can be very helpful in creating white space on the webpage
  <li>Setting parent margins left and right to auto will center give equal space to text on each side of the box
  <li> Donâ€™t be afraid to style the border using images, box shadows, and rounded corners 
</ol>
