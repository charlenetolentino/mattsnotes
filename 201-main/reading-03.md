## Lists in HTML

There are a few kinds of lists in HTML. Ordered, unordered and definition lists. Each having their own purposes. 

The ordered list can list out instructions in a recipe.

HTML Example:

    <ol>
      <li> Fold in egg whites </li>
      <li> Sift in Flour </li>
      <li> Gently mix in eggs yolks </li>
    </ol>

<ol>
      <li> Fold in egg whites </li>
      <li> Sift in Flour </li>
      <li> Gently mix in eggs yolks </li>
    </ol>

The unordered list can list out a grocery list.

HTML Example:

      <ul>
        <li> Eggs </li>
        <li> Flour </li>
        <li> Milk </li>
      </ul>

<ul>
      <li> Eggs </li>
      <li> Flour </li>
      <li> Milk </li>
    </ul>


Finally, the definition list can set terms with its own definition.

HTML Example: 

    <dl>
      <dt>Pokemon</dt>
      <dd> a series of Japanese video games and related media featuring cartoon monsters that are captured by players and trained to battle each other.</dd>
