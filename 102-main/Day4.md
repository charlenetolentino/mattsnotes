## Who is HTML?

HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage and its main uses is to create structre to a web page. The word *hypertext* is refering to the tags used in a HTML page.

Below is a sample of a few lines in HTML
     
     
         <ul>
            <li> Home </li>
            <li> Reviews </li>
            <li> Contact </li>
         </ul>

This HTML code represents a navigation page on a web site. Notice the commands are in these brakets <> to help when the command begins and </> when it ends. 

The \<ul> command is telling Who ever is written below will be and unordered list.

Then \<li> is where you place the text for the navigation button.

At the end of each command there must be an ending braket. In this case it is \</ul> and \</li> respectively.



**Note:** HTML only work on the structre of the page. Any styling like pictures, text size, and fonts will be done in CSS.
