## How to write script in JS?

Script is a series of instruction that a computer needs to reach a goal. To write script you will need to pick a goal then write the steps to complete the task.

These are the steps to follow:

1.	Define the goal
1.	Design the script
1.	Code each step

Unlike humans, computers solve problems programmatically meaning they need a step by step approach. Think like the procedure in a science experiment. You need to follow every single instruction to get the expected results. If you deviate or skip instructions the results might be disastrous. One way to help in the design of the script is to use a flow chart to work out each step needed to complete the task. 

In JS the stings of code are comprised up of expressions. An expression evaluates to a single value

    var promtQuestion = "Do you prefer a fries or onion rings?”.

This expression is shows that the varible ‘promtQuestion’ is equal to the text ‘Do you prefer a fries or onion rings?’

Inside the expression will be an operator. In this case it is the “=” sign.

Using these tools we are able to write the code needed to complete any task we decide.
