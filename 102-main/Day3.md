## What is Git?

To understand Git, you will first need to understand what a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is. A DVCS is a tool used by members of a team to work on a project collaboratively. This is done by creating a repository on the DVCS that the members of a team will copy to their local drive so they can work on separate task at the same time. There are many brands of a DVCS that provide different features that some companies will love, and others will hate. Much like a text editor a team of programmers will work together to find which DVCS will better fit their needs. Git is a very popular DVCS that many teams and companies choose to manage their projects. 

TLDR; All Git is a DVCS, not all DVCS is Git.

Below is a graphic of how a DVCS like Git works. Git files will be in one of 3 stages: Committed, Modified and Staged
    
    Committed (Working Directory)
	    This is the copy of the repository that an individual has saved to their local drive
    Modified (Staging Area)
	    At this stage you can edit, add, and delete code
     Staged (Repository)
	    The work you intended to edit, add, and/or delete is not queued to commit to the repository
