## What is a computer?

A computer is a tool use by people designed to manipualte information. 

All compoters do the same 4 tasks:
 1. Input
 1. Store information
 1. Processor
 1. Output

The most common inputs to computers today are the mouse an keyboard. Historically paper punch cards and paper tape where used instead. 

Once the input is received it travels between the processor, the comptuers brain, and a storage device like a hardrive once the input is finished processing.

Finally, when the input data is finally ready it will be sent to an output device like a monitor or speakers.


No matter how old all computers work in this basic way. 


##How does a coumtper work?

You might of heard that a comptuer only knows 2 things; 1 or 0. Thats only kind of true. Inside a computers processor there are billoions of switches that we can turn on or off (or set to 1 or 0). A single switch is called a bit. A series of bits is called a byte. With these groupings of bytes you are able to represents values such as numbers, letters, pictures, and sounds. We don't interact with these switches directly today but in the past programers physically had to turn on these bits to get the computer to work in the way they want.
