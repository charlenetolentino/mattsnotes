## What is a computer?

A computer is a tool use by people designed to manipualte information. 

All compoters do the same 4 tasks:
 1. Input
 1. Store information
 1. Processor
 1. Output

The most common inputs to computers today are the mouse an keyboard. Historically paper punch cards and paper tape where used instead. 

Once the input is received it travels between the processor, the comptuers brain, and a storage device like a hardrive once the input is finished processing.

Finally, when the input data is finally ready it will be sent to an output device like a monitor or speakers.


No matter how old all computers work in this basic way.
