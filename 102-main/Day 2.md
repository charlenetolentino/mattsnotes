## What is a Text Editor?

  A text editor is a piece of software that is installed on your PC that allows you to edit text you use to build a website. There are many features in a text editor that users should look for while shopping around. These features are not limited to code completion, syntax highlighting, and a large selection of extensions. Text editors are a dime a dozen, so it is up to the programmer to try and find the best editor that fills all their needs. Note that all operating systems comes with a text editor preinstalled, Text Edit on iOS and Notpad on Windows, these are very basic and donâ€™t have as many features as listed above. As a bonus there is also another tool that programmers used called an Integrated Development Environment or IDE.  Imagine the entire Microsoft Office suite but instead of Excel or Word you have a text editor, debugger, and complier. These are tools that a programmer will likely use but for most programmers will just choose a third-party editor and used an IDE when it suites them.
