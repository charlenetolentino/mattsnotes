## What is CSS?

CSS is a programing language that deals with the styling of a web page.  It works with HTML to make it look the way you want. CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. By referring to the HTML tags such as < body> or < section> we can manipulate the fonts, pixel size, spacings, margins and colors using CSS. 

Here is sample code of CSS line

    h1 {
    background-color:#A3BA34;
    color: rgb(23, 15, 52) 
    font-size: 400%;}

At the top you will see the _h1_ tag. This means that this styling command will only effect the _h1_ header. 

The next line is the background color. In this case the color is chosen using a HEX Code

The following line is also a color command but for the lettering in the header. Colors can also be chosen using an rbg value

Finally the last line manipluates the font size in the notation of a percentage reletive to the original size.

**NOTE** You are able to add the CSS straight to the HTML file but it is best practice to create and work on a seperate CSS page to keep code orginized.
