## What is CSS?

CSS is a programing language that deals with the styling of a web page.  It works with HTML to make it look the way you want. CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets. By referring to the HTML tags such as < body> or < section> we can manipulate the fonts, pixel size, spacings, margins and colors using CSS.
