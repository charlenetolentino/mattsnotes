## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a scripting language used to make web pages interactive and dynamic. HTML is used to structure the page; CSS is used to style, and JS brings its all together by giving the webpage life. Without it we will still have a fully function website, but it will lack a personal touch with the user. Using JS, you can set variables to do different actions if and when prompted to do so.  

Below is the exapmle JS code from my repo

    var promtQuestion = "Do you prefer fries or onion rings?";
    



Using the syntax "var" we are able to delcare a variable. We will then need to name the vaule and in this case it is "promtQuestion". Finally we will need to assign that variable a value which is "Do you prefer fries or onion rings?"
     
We can now use the variable "promtQuestion" for when we want to ask this question.
